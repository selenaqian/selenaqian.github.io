    <p>The CHS Acumen website is near and dear to my heart. I was part of <i>The Acumen</i> for three years, designing my first year, then becoming an associate editor and finally the editor in chief. Although the website is <del>incredibly</del> <ins>a little</ins> annoying to work with because there are so many little boxes to remember to check, the end result is <b>beautiful</b>.</p>
    <p>Some of the things I've worked on include:</p>
    <ul>

    <h3 id="amazon"><a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a></h3>
    <img src="Images/amazon.png" height="500"/>
    <p>Amazon is <i>great</i>. It's fairly easy to find anything and everything I'm looking for, and of course, the <b>free</b> <sup>two-day</sup> <sub>shipping</sub> included with Prime doesn't hurt either. I bought my textbooks on there for <i>half</i> the price the Duke Textbook Store was offering. It's super convenient to be able to find it all just right there and have stuff delivered to the door instead of having to go out and search for hours to maybe not even find what you want.</p>
